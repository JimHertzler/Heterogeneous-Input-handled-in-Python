# Heterogeneous-Input-handled-in-Python
This is a python-script that has saved me much trouble, down through the years.
<br/>
When run in your working-directory, it moves all the files to sub-directories that are named after the file-types.
<br/>
I typically use it when someone starts giving me heterogeneous input files.
<br/>
I will "cd" into the directory containing the files and run this python-script.
<br/>
Next, I will write scripts that are named after the new sub-directories.
<br/>
Each new script handles the homogenous file types in its sub-directory. Once handled, files are moved to the trash.
<br/>
As new and unexpected file-types appear, their sub-directory will be created and will fill up with files.
<br/>
Noticing this, I will write a new script to handle this new file-type.
